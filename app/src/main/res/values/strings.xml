    <string name="bio">Hi! My name is Polly.
\n\nI like knitting.
\n\nKnitting is a method by which yarn is manipulated to create a textile or fabric;
\n\nit is used in many types of garments. Knitting may be done by hand or by machine.
\n\nKnitting creates stitches: loops of yarn in a row, either flat or in the round.
\n\nThere are usually many active stitches on the knitting needle at one time.
\n\nKnitting was initially a male-only occupation.
\n\nIn fact, when the very first knitting union was established in Paris in 1527,
        \n\nno women were allowed. When the knitting machine was invented,
        \n\nhand knitting became useful but nonessential. Like quilting, spinning, and needlepoint,
        \n\nknitting has become a leisurely activity.
        \n\nYou can ask me if you are interested on something else.\n\n</string>
